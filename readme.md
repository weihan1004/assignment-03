## Shape Animation

### Requirements

- Write the following classes:
    - `Point`
        - Describes a point in the Euclidean plane.
            - Note: This means that the x and y values need to be either
              `float` or `double`.
        - Must be able to be initialized with no arguments, defaulting to the
          point (0,0).
            - Note: This is the same as saying that it must have a default
              constructor.  If a constructor has default values for all
              arguments, it fulfills this requirement and is considered a
              default constructor.
        - Must be able to be initialized with an x and y value.
        - Must not be possible to change the x or y value once it has been
          constructed.
            - Note: This means that the member variables containing the x and y
              values must be private (or protected), and you must implement
              getters (but not setters) for each.

    - `Shape`
        - Must contain at least the following pure virtual function:

            ```c++
            virtual bool contains(const Point & p) const = 0;
            ```

    - `Rectangle` and `Ellipse`
        - Must inherit from `Shape`, and be concrete classes (i.e. not abstract
          classes, i.e. they must override all `Shape`s pure virtual
          functions).

    - `Square`
        - Must inherit from `Rectangle`.

    - `Circle`
        - Must inherit from `Ellipse`.

- Write a function with the following prototype (probably in `main.cpp`):

    ```c++
    /**
     * A function to draw the `Shape`s in `s` in a terminal.
     *
     * Arguments:
     * - `count`: The number of `Shape`s in `s`.
     * - `s`: An array containing pointers to each `Shape` to draw.
     *
     * Notes:
     * - A terminal window is typically 80 columns wide by 25 lines high.
     * - The width:height aspect ratio of a terminal character is approximately
     *   1:1.9.
     */
    void draw(const int count, const Shape * const s[]);
    ```

  This function should iterate through every column on every line.  If the
  point represented by the character at that location is contained in any of
  the `Shape`s, it should print a `"*"` (or something).  If not, it should
  print a `" "` (or something).

  This function should also scale the shapes correctly, according the aspect
  ratio of the terminal characters.  It would probably be best to use several
  constants: one to represent the number of columns, one to represent the
  factor used to convert the column number to the x value represented by a
  character in that column, and similarly for the number of lines and the
  factor used to convert the line number to the corresponding y value.

  Optionally, you may also draw a boarder, where the top and bottom of each
  column is a `"-"` (or something), and the first and last character of each
  line is a `"|"` (or something).

- Use the following template for `main()`:

    ```c++
    int main() {
        // declare constants for the number of frames to draw and the
        // amount of time to sleep after drawing each frame

        // for each frame

            // create some shapes (with values depending on the current frame
            // number)

            // put pointers to them in an array
            //
            // for example, given a `Rectangle r` and a `Square s`:
            Shape * shapes[] = { &r, &s, };
            // this is possible because `Rectangle`s and `Squares`, and all
            // your other shapes, inherit from `Shape`

            // draw the shapes in the terminal
            //
            // for example, given the `shapes` array above:
            draw( sizeof(shapes) / sizeof(Shape *), shapes );

            // wait before drawing the next frame
            //
            // for example:
            std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(frameSleep));
            // if you'd like to know more about what this line is doing, look
            // up the documentation for `std::this_thread::sleep_for` and
            // `std::chrono::milliseconds()`.

        return 0;  // success
    }
    ```

  If you'd like to write your `main()` in a different way that's fine, so long
  as it accomplishes the same goal.


#### Design Constraints

- Classes must have both `.h` and `.cpp` files, with member functions defined
  in the `.cpp` files unless they are truly trivial.  If it makes sense, you
  may put multiple classes into one pair of `.h` and `.cpp` files.  I suggest
  having a `point.h` and `point.cpp`, and a `shapes.h` and `shapes.cpp`.

- `main()` must have its own `.cpp` file.  I suggest calling it `main.cpp`.

- Declare member functions and function arguments as `const` when appropriate
  (pretty much whenever possible).

- Use "include guards" in all `.h` files.  Be sure to give the preprocessor
  variable a name corresponding to the file name.  For example, in `point.h`:

    ```c++
    #ifndef POINT_H
    #define POINT_H
    // ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    // ... everything besides the copyright information and file description

    // ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    #endif  // POINT_H
    ```

#### Style

- Document and format your code well and consistently.
- Wrap lines at 79 or 80 columns whenever possible.
- End your file with a blank line.
- Do *not* use `using namespace std;`.  You may get around typing `std::` in
  front of things or with, e.g., `using std::cout;`.
- Include your copyright and license information at the top of every file,
  followed by a brief description of the file's contents, e.g.

    ```c++
    /* ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     * Copyright &copy; 2015 Ben Blazak <bblazak@fullerton.edu>
     * Released under the [MIT License] (http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
     * ------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

    /**
     * A short program to print "Hello World!" to standard output.
     */
    ```


### Assumptions

- A terminal window is 80 columns wide by 25 lines high.
- The width:height aspect ratio of a terminal character is approximately 1:1.9.


### Notes

- If you need help creating a file in GitHub (especially if you're still using
  the web interface instead of the desktop app or the terminal) see [GitHub
  Help / Manipulating Files / Creating new
  files](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-new-files/).

- If you'd like more of a challenge, try implementing more complex shapes or
  animations.  Be creative!

- If you'd like to use a graphics library of some sort, perhaps
  [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org) please do!  I wanted to use one rather than
  simply printing to the terminal, but I couldn't justify making it a
  requirement (and I also didn't have enough time to experiment).
